# 🐉 Kali Linux — Set Static IP with `nmcli` (Proxmox NAT)

This guide explains how to configure a static IPv4 address on a Kali Linux VM using NetworkManager (`nmcli`) when running on a Proxmox NAT bridge.

## Step 1: List NetworkManager Connections

```bash
nmcli connection show
````

Example output:

```text
Wired connection 1
```

> Important: Modify the connection name (e.g., `Wired connection 1`), not the interface name.

## Step 2: Bind the Connection to the NIC

```bash
sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" connection.interface-name ens18
```

This ensures the connection is attached to the correct network interface.

## Step 3: Configure the Static IPv4 Address

Example Proxmox NAT configuration:

* Subnet: `192.168.253.0/24`
* Gateway: `192.168.253.1`

```bash
sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" \
  ipv4.method manual \
  ipv4.addresses 192.168.253.50/24 \
  ipv4.gateway 192.168.253.1 \
  ipv4.dns "1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8"
```

Notes:

* Replace `192.168.253.50` with an unused IP
* Ensure the gateway matches your Proxmox NAT bridge

## Step 4: Restart the Network Connection

```bash
sudo nmcli connection down "Wired connection 1"
sudo nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1"
```

A brief network interruption is expected.

## Step 5: Verify Configuration

```bash
ip a
ip route
```

Expected results:

* Static IP assigned to `ens18`
* Default route via `192.168.253.1`

## Step 6: Test Connectivity

```bash
ping 192.168.253.1
ping 8.8.8.8
ping google.com
```

All tests should succeed.

## Troubleshooting

If the interface shows as unmanaged:

```bash
nmcli device status
sudo nmcli device set ens18 managed yes
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

Reset the network connection (last resort):

```bash
sudo nmcli connection delete "Wired connection 1"
sudo nmcli connection add type ethernet ifname ens18 con-name kali-static
```

Reapply the static IP configuration using `kali-static`.

## Quick Command Summary

```bash
nmcli con show
nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" connection.interface-name ens18
nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses 192.168.253.50/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.253.1 ipv4.dns "1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8"
nmcli con down "Wired connection 1"
nmcli con up "Wired connection 1"
```

Notes for lab environments:

* Use NAT for internet access
* Use internal bridges for attack/defense labs
* Dual-NIC Kali setups are recommended for SOC and pentesting labs
