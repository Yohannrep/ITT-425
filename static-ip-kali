# 🐉 Kali Linux — Set Static IP with `nmcli` (Proxmox NAT)

This guide explains how to configure a **static IPv4 address** on a **Kali Linux VM** using **NetworkManager (`nmcli`)** when running on a **Proxmox NAT bridge**.

---

## 📌 Prerequisites

- Kali Linux with NetworkManager enabled
- VM connected to a Proxmox NAT bridge
- Network interface (commonly `ens18` on Proxmox)

---

## 🧭 Step 1: List NetworkManager Connections

```bash
nmcli connection show
````

Example output:

```text
Wired connection 1
```

> ⚠️ **Important**
> You modify the **connection name** (e.g., `Wired connection 1`), **not** the interface name.

---

## 🔗 Step 2: Bind the Connection to the NIC

Attach the NetworkManager connection to the correct interface:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" connection.interface-name ens18
```

This resolves cases where the NIC exists but is not actively connected.

---

## 🌐 Step 3: Configure the Static IPv4 Address

### Example Proxmox NAT Settings

| Setting | Value              |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Subnet  | `192.168.253.0/24` |
| Gateway | `192.168.253.1`    |

```bash
sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" \
  ipv4.method manual \
  ipv4.addresses 192.168.253.50/24 \
  ipv4.gateway 192.168.253.1 \
  ipv4.dns "1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8"
```

### Notes

* Replace `192.168.253.50` with any unused IP
* Ensure the gateway matches your Proxmox NAT bridge
* DNS can be internal or public

---

## 🔄 Step 4: Restart the Network Connection

```bash
sudo nmcli connection down "Wired connection 1"
sudo nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1"
```

> A brief network drop is expected.

---

## ✅ Step 5: Verify Configuration

```bash
ip a
ip route
```

Expected results:

* Static IP assigned to `ens18`
* Default route via `192.168.253.1`

---

## 🌍 Step 6: Test Connectivity

```bash
ping 192.168.253.1
ping 8.8.8.8
ping google.com
```

All tests should succeed.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Interface Shows as `unmanaged`

Check device status:

```bash
nmcli device status
```

Fix it:

```bash
sudo nmcli device set ens18 managed yes
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

---

### Reset the Network Connection (Last Resort)

```bash
sudo nmcli connection delete "Wired connection 1"
sudo nmcli connection add type ethernet ifname ens18 con-name kali-static
```

Reapply the static IP configuration using `kali-static`.

---

## ⚡ Quick Command Summary

```bash
nmcli con show
nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" connection.interface-name ens18
nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses 192.168.253.50/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.253.1 ipv4.dns "1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8"
nmcli con down "Wired connection 1"
nmcli con up "Wired connection 1"
```

---

## 🧪 Notes for Lab Environments

* Use **NAT** for internet access
* Use **internal bridges** for attack/defense labs
* Dual-NIC Kali setups are recommended for SOC and pentesting labs

📎 Tested on Kali Linux running on Proxmox VE

If you want, I can also format this to match:
- 📁 **GCU lab style**
- 📘 **Student-friendly version**
- 🧠 **SOC / Pentest repo layout**

Just say the vibe 😎
